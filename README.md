Promotion Engine

We need you to implement a simple promotion engine for a checkout process. Our Cart contains a list of single character SKU ids (A, B, C....) over which the promotion engine will need to run.

Following are the Frameworks and Technologies

1) Sprint Boot
2) Java 8
3) Postgres

Following are the features

1) Implemented an algorithm to apply promotion on items.
2) Used decorator pattern and chain of responsibility design pattern.
3) Can add new promotion based on the algorithm implmented.
4) Microservice based architecture can be called from any service to apply promotions.
5) Validation applied.
6) Used Solid principles.
7) Central exception handling.
8) Postgres DB used.
9) Instance cache used for better readablity.


Following can be improved in this repo

1) Centralized auditing via AOP(Ascept oriented programming)
2) Can improve the algorithm by multipromotions etc.
3) Table design can be modified to accomodate generalised promotions.
4) Improve the instance level caching using avaliable cache frameworks.
5) Apply Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.
