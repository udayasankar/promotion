Promotion Engine

We need you to implement a simple promotion engine for a checkout process. Our Cart contains a list of single character SKU ids (A, B, C....) over which the promotion engine will need to run.

Following are the Frameworks and Technologies

Spring Boot
Java 8
Postgres

Following are the features

1) Implemented an algorithm to apply promotion on items.
2) Used decorator pattern and chain of responsibility design pattern.
3) Can add new promotions based on the algorithm implemented.
4) Microservice based architecture can be called from any service to apply promotions.
5) Validation applied.
6) Used Solid principles.
7) Central exception handling.
8) Postgres DB used.
9) Instance cache used for better readability.
10) Used TDD based approach.

Following can be improved in this repo

1) Centralized auditing via AOP(Aspect oriented programming)
2) Can improve the algorithm by multi promotions etc.
3) Table design can be modified to accommodate generalised promotions.
4) Improve the instance level caching using available cache frameworks.
5) Apply Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.
6) Can write Integration test cases also.
7) Apply distributed tracing.
